# Problem Statement
The aim of this project is to build a classic Hangman game using Python. Here a player tries to guess a randomly selected word within a limited number of attempts. The game must provide interactive feedback, track scores and wins, and support repeated gameplay.

# Scope of the Project
1. Develop a functional, classic game called Hangman running in the command line.
2. Allow players to play new games repeatedly in a single session and detect their scores and the number of games played.
3. Provide random word selection for each game, user-friendly feedback.
4. Maintain readable, and maintainable code that adheres to best practices for Python scripting.

# Target Users
1.Students and beginners learning Python programming and basic control flow in the program.

2.Anyone seeking a entertaining and interactive word-guessing game that can be played from the command line.
3. Educators who want to demonstrate the use of lists, loops, and conditionals in a real-world context like Hangman game.

# High-Level Features
1. Random word selection from a provided list of words for every new game.
2. Input handling for single-letter guesses and progress.
3. Hangman "stage" visualization that shows up with each incorrect guess.
4. Win and loss tracking code with required messages and the facility to restart the game.
5. Scoreboard at the end of the session showing number of games played and games won.
6. Clean code structure that provides easy updates or expansion of the word list.
